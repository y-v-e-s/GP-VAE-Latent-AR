VAE-GP and VAE-AR reach similar perplexities, but differ sharply at long horizons.  
Without latent autoregression, smooth GP priors collapse in long generations, while latent-AR maintains coherent sequences.  
Result: **causal structure in latent space matters more than token-level autoregression for long-range stability.**
