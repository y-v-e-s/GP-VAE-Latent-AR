## Independence of the Code Files

Each script in this repository is fully independent and can be executed on its own.  
There is no global dependency between the files: you may run any module separately, depending on what you want to test or explore.

Some scripts may require additional libraries that are not included in every environment.  
The exact requirements depend on your local setup (Python version, GPU support, installed packages, etc.).  
If a script fails due to a missing dependency, simply install the corresponding library as indicated in the error message.
