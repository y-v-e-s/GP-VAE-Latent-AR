## Abstract

We investigate a fully **latent autoregressive** scheme based on a **Gaussian Process (GP)**
integrated into a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**. In this setting, sequential dynamics are
transferred from the observation space to a continuous latent space, while linguistic generation
remains parallel through a non-autoregressive decoder.

We present a complete methodological formulation, including a **causal GP prior**, a
**structured amortized posterior**, and a training protocol based on a **regularized ELBO**.
Empirical evaluation, conducted within a deliberately constrained **proof-of-concept (POC)**
framework, shows that the model can be trained stably and that the sequential and parallel
sampling variants exhibit consistent behavior.

Overall, the results suggest that part of the temporal structure in a language model can be
supported by the **probabilistic geometry of the latent space**, rather than by explicit
token-level autoregressive neural operations.
